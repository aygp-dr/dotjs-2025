* Overview
This is a sample template showing how to use bibliography and citations in your conference notes.

* Key Points
- Use the bibliography system for referencing external sources
- Include citations in your notes with the cite syntax
- Export to various formats while maintaining citation structure

* Using Citations

When discussing JavaScript design patterns, it's helpful to reference established works like [cite:@osmani2017learning] and [cite:@crockford2008javascript]. For modern ES6 features, Kyle Simpson's work is particularly helpful [cite:@simpson2015you].

** Advanced Topics with References

When discussing local-first applications, refer to the groundbreaking work by Kleppmann et al. [cite:@localfirst2025]. The recent developments in JavaScript engine performance were outlined by Resig [cite:@resig2025jsperformance].

For information on memory management in Node.js, the official documentation is very helpful [cite:@nodejs2025storage].

* Code Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
// Example of modern ES6 features from Kyle Simpson's work
// Reference: @simpson2015you

// Using destructuring
const { name, age } = person;

// Arrow functions
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

// Default parameters
function multiply(a, b = 1) {
  return a * b;
}

// Implementing design patterns (Osmani, 2017)
// Reference: @osmani2017learning
class Singleton {
  static instance;
  
  constructor() {
    if (Singleton.instance) {
      return Singleton.instance;
    }
    
    Singleton.instance = this;
  }
}
#+END_SRC

* Bibliography
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no
:END:

This repository includes a comprehensive bibliography in =resources/bibliography/references.bib=. To use it in your own notes, include the following header in your org files:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+CITE_EXPORT: csl
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then reference sources using the cite syntax:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[cite:@author2025title]
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Exporting

When exporting to HTML, PDF, or other formats, citations will be properly formatted according to the CSL style.

To export:
1. Use C-c C-e h h for HTML export
2. Use C-c C-e l p for LaTeX/PDF export
