* Conference Theme Analysis

Based on the talk titles and speakers, the dotJS 2025 conference appears focused on several emerging themes:

1. *AI Integration with JavaScript*: Multiple talks address AI integration, from running models directly in JavaScript to using AI for code generation and web agents.

2. *Evolution of JavaScript Ecosystems*: Talks from creators like Ryan Dahl and thought leaders like Sarah Drasner suggest major announcements or insights about where JavaScript frameworks and runtimes are heading.

3. *Local-First and Web 2.5*: Kyle Simpson's talk suggests a shift toward more resilient, offline-capable applications that maintain the benefits of web applications.

4. *Performance Optimization*: Several talks focus on different aspects of performance, from memory management to HTTP compression techniques.

5. *Developer Experience*: Talks about neurodiversity (ADHD), creative applications (MIDI), and physical computing suggest a broadening of what constitutes JavaScript development.

This analysis will be updated as the conference progresses and actual content is noted.

* Setup for Code Examples

This file serves as a template for tracking code examples from the conference.

** Basic Example Template

,#+BEGIN_SRC javascript :tangle ./demos/example-template.js
/**
 * Example from [Speaker] - [Talk Title]
 * dotJS 2025 - April 3, 2025
 * 
 * Description: [Brief description of what this code demonstrates]
 */

// Code example here
console.log('Example dotJS 2025 code');

// Export if needed
export const exampleFunction = () => {
  // Implementation
};
,#+END_SRC

** Test Setup Template

,#+BEGIN_SRC javascript :tangle ./demos/example-test-template.js
/**
 * Tests for example from [Speaker] - [Talk Title]
 * dotJS 2025 - April 3, 2025
 */

import { exampleFunction } from './example-template.js';

// Simple test
console.log('Testing example function...');
const result = exampleFunction();
console.log('Result:', result);
,#+END_SRC

** Example Topics to Track

Based on the conference agenda, prepare to capture examples on:

- AI model integration in JavaScript
- Local-first/offline patterns
- Web MIDI API usage
- Performance optimization techniques
- New framework patterns
- Node.js memory management

Each will be captured in separate files as speakers present their material.
