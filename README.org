* dotJS 2025 Conference Notes

This repository contains personal notes, resources, and code examples from the dotJS 2025 conference held on April 3, 2025, at Folies Berg√®re, 32 rue Richer, 75009 Paris.

** Repository Structure

- =talks/= - Notes from conference talks (morning and afternoon sessions)
- =notes/= - Additional personal notes and lightning talk notes
- =code-examples/= - Code snippets and demos from the talks
- =resources/= - Slides, references, and bibliography
- =diagrams/= - Visual representations of concepts
- =lisp/= - Emacs Lisp utilities for working with the repository
- =scripts/= - Shell scripts for repository setup and maintenance

** Quick Start

1. Run the setup script to initialize the repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   #+END_SRC

2. Load the Elisp environment in Emacs:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (load-file "~/projects/aygp-dr/dotjs-2025/lisp/dotjs-init.el")
   #+END_SRC

3. Explore the talk notes in the =talks/= directory

4. Use the tangle script to extract code from Org files:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   # Tangle a specific file
   ./scripts/tangle.sh talks/morning-sessions/ryan-dahl-special-announcement.org
   
   # Tangle all Org files
   ./scripts/tangle.sh --all
   
   # Detangle (sync from source back to Org)
   ./scripts/tangle.sh --detangle talks/morning-sessions/ryan-dahl-special-announcement.org
   #+END_SRC

** Key Features

- *Org-mode Integration*: All notes use Org-mode with Babel for code execution
- *Tangle/Detangle*: Code blocks can be extracted to standalone files and synchronized back
- *Bibliography Support*: Citations are managed via =resources/bibliography/references.bib=
- *Emacs Lisp Utilities*: Custom functions for working with the repository

** Conference Topics

The conference covers several major themes:

- AI Integration with JavaScript (models, agents, code generation)
- Modern Architecture (framework evolution, routing, Web 2.5)
- JavaScript Runtime Advancements
- Local-First and Offline Capabilities
- Creative Web Applications

** Important Talks
