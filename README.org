* dotJS 2025 Conference Notes

This repository contains personal notes, resources, and code examples from the dotJS 2025 conference held on April 3, 2025, at Folies Berg√®re, 32 rue Richer, 75009 Paris.

** Repository Structure

- =talks/= - Notes from conference talks (morning and afternoon sessions)
- =notes/= - Additional personal notes and lightning talk notes
- =code-examples/= - Code snippets and demos from the talks
- =resources/= - Slides, references, and bibliography
- =diagrams/= - Visual representations of concepts
- =lisp/= - Emacs Lisp utilities for working with the repository
- =scripts/= - Shell scripts for repository setup and maintenance

** Environment Setup

This repository is designed to work with the following tools:

*** Development Tools
- Node.js v18+ and npm 9+ (for JavaScript examples)
- Python 3.11+ (for utilities and analysis)
- Emacs 31.0.50+ (for Org-mode and literate programming)
- Guile 3.0.8+ (for Scheme examples)
- Shellcheck and shfmt (for shell script linting)
- Mermaid CLI (for diagram generation)
- ImageMagick (for image processing)

*** Installing Required Tools

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Node.js tools
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli eslint

# Shell tools 
sudo apt-get install -y shellcheck shfmt

# Python tools - choose one approach:
# Option 1: Using pip
pip install ruff black pytest jupyter

# Option 2: Using Poetry (preferred for dependency isolation)
# We're using Poetry 2.1.1
# The project already has pyproject.toml and poetry.lock files
poetry install  # This will install all dependencies from the lockfile

# Ensure Emacs is configured with org-mode
# See lisp/dotjs-init.el for Emacs configuration
#+END_SRC

** Quick Start

1. Run the setup script *once* to initialize the repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   #+END_SRC
   This creates the directory structure and basic files. *Only needs to be run once*.

2. Load the Elisp environment in Emacs:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (load-file "~/projects/aygp-dr/dotjs-2025/lisp/dotjs-init.el")
   #+END_SRC

3. Explore the talk notes in the =talks/= directory

4. Use specialized scripts for ongoing tasks:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   # Generate new talk templates (if needed)
   ./scripts/generate-templates.sh
   
   # Tangle a specific file (extract code)
   ./scripts/tangle.sh talks/morning-sessions/ryan-dahl-special-announcement.org
   
   # Tangle all Org files
   ./scripts/tangle.sh --all
   
   # Detangle (sync from source back to Org)
   ./scripts/tangle.sh --detangle talks/morning-sessions/ryan-dahl-special-announcement.org
   #+END_SRC

** Key Features

- *Org-mode Integration*: All notes use Org-mode with Babel for code execution
- *Tangle/Detangle*: Code blocks can be extracted to standalone files and synchronized back
- *Bibliography Support*: Citations are managed via =resources/bibliography/references.bib=
- *Emacs Lisp Utilities*: Custom functions for working with the repository
- *Technology Focus*: Support for JavaScript/Node.js, Python, and Scheme code samples
- *Diagram Generation*: Integrated Mermaid diagrams for visualizing concepts

** Conference Topics

The conference covers several major themes:

- AI Integration with JavaScript (models, agents, code generation)
- Modern Architecture (framework evolution, routing, Web 2.5)
- JavaScript Runtime Advancements
- Local-First and Offline Capabilities
- Creative Web Applications

** Important Talks

- Ryan Dahl's special announcement (creator of Node.js and Deno)
- Kyle Simpson on Local-First Web Applications [cite:@simpson2015you] [cite:@localfirst2025]
- Wes Bos on AI models in JavaScript
- Angie Jones on AI Agents and the Programmable Web
