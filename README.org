* dotJS 2025 Conference Notes

This repository contains personal notes, resources, and code examples from the dotJS 2025 conference held on April 3, 2025, at Folies Berg√®re, 32 rue Richer, 75009 Paris.

** Repository Structure

- =talks/= - Notes from conference talks (morning and afternoon sessions)
- =notes/= - Additional personal notes and lightning talk notes
- =code-examples/= - Code snippets and demos from the talks
- =resources/= - Slides, references, and bibliography
- =diagrams/= - Visual representations of concepts
- =lisp/= - Emacs Lisp utilities for working with the repository
- =scripts/= - Helper scripts for tasks that are too complex for the Makefile
- =Makefile= - Simple commands for common tasks (tangle, detangle, export)

** Environment Setup

This repository is designed to work with the following tools:

*** Development Tools
- Node.js v18+ and npm 9+ (for JavaScript examples)
- Python 3.11+ (for utilities and analysis)
- Emacs 31.0.50+ (for Org-mode and literate programming)
- Guile 3.0.8+ (for Scheme examples)
- Shellcheck and shfmt (for shell script linting)
- Mermaid CLI (for diagram generation)
- ImageMagick (for image processing)

*** Dependencies

This project requires the following tools:

- *Emacs* (31.0+) with org-mode for document management
- *Node.js* (18.0+) for JavaScript code execution
- *Python* (3.11+) for utilities and analysis
- *Poetry* (2.1+) for Python dependency management

*** Setup

Run the following to prepare your environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Install Python dependencies (recommended)
make setup-python

# Alternatively, if you prefer using pip directly:
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

The project uses standard =make= targets for all operations:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Show all available commands
make help
#+END_SRC

** Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   git clone https://github.com/aygp-dr/dotjs-2025.git
   cd dotjs-2025
   #+END_SRC

2. Set up the environment:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   # Install Python dependencies
   make setup-python
   #+END_SRC

3. Open any file in Emacs and the project settings will be automatically loaded via `.dir-locals.el`.

4. Explore the talk notes in the =talks/= directory

5. Available project operations:

   *** Common Tasks
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   # Show all available commands
   make
   
   # Export documentation to HTML
   make html
   
   # Check all files for issues
   make lint
   #+END_SRC
   
   *** Working with Code Blocks
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   # Extract code blocks from Org files
   make tangle
   
   # Sync code back to Org files
   make detangle
   
   # Remove generated files
   make clean
   #+END_SRC

** Key Features

- *Org-mode Integration*: All notes use Org-mode with Babel for code execution
- *Tangle/Detangle*: Code blocks can be extracted to standalone files and synchronized back
- *Bibliography Support*: Citations are managed via =resources/bibliography/references.bib=
- *Emacs Lisp Utilities*: Custom functions for working with the repository
- *Technology Focus*: Support for JavaScript/Node.js, Python, and Scheme code samples
- *Diagram Generation*: Integrated Mermaid diagrams for visualizing concepts

** Conference Topics

The conference covers several major themes:

- AI Integration with JavaScript (models, agents, code generation)
- Modern Architecture (framework evolution, routing, Web 2.5)
- JavaScript Runtime Advancements
- Local-First and Offline Capabilities
- Creative Web Applications

** Important Talks

- Ryan Dahl's special announcement (creator of Node.js and Deno)
- Kyle Simpson on Local-First Web Applications [cite:@simpson2015you] [cite:@localfirst2025]
- Wes Bos on AI models in JavaScript
- Angie Jones on AI Agents and the Programmable Web
